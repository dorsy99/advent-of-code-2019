# Advent of Code 2019

Hello, and welcome to my repository. I'm trying to teach myself GIT at the same time as completing the AoC (for the first time) so it may not be up to date / simple / working.

Remember, you don't learn anything if you copy ;)

I have joined the ServiceNow leaderboard, hit me up on SNDevs Slack <3
